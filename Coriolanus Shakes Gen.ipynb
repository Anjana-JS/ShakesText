Since their\\nmore mature dignities and royal necessities made\\nseparation of their society, their encounters,\\nthough not personal, have been royally attorneyed\\nwith interchange of gifts, letters, loving\\nembassies; that they have seemed to be together,\\nthough absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and\\nembraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed\\nwinds. The heavens continue their loves!\\n\\nARCHIDAMUS:\\nI think there is not in the world either malice or\\nmatter to alter it. You have an unspeakable\\ncomfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a\\ngentleman of the greatest promise that ever came\\ninto my note.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it\\nis a gallant child; one that indeed physics the\\nsubject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on\\ncrutches ere he was born desire yet their life to\\nsee him a man.\\n\\nARCHIDAMUS:\\nWould they else be content to die?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nYes; if there were no other excuse why they should\\ndesire to live.\\n\\nARCHIDAMUS:\\nIf the king had no son, they would desire to live\\non crutches till he had one.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nNine changes of the watery star hath been\\nThe shepherd's note since we have left our throne\\nWithout a burthen: time as long again\\nWould be find up, my brother, with our thanks;\\nAnd yet we should, for perpetuity,\\nGo hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,\\nYet standing in rich place, I multiply\\nWith one 'We thank you' many thousands moe\\nThat go before it.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nStay your thanks a while;\\nAnd pay them when you part.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nSir, that's to-morrow.\\nI am question'd by my fears, of what may chance\\nOr breed upon our absence; that may blow\\nNo sneaping winds at home, to make us say\\n'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd\\nTo tire your royalty.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWe are tougher, brother,\\nThan you can put us to't.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nNo longer stay.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOne seven-night longer.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nVery sooth, to-morrow.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWe'll part the time between's then; and in that\\nI'll no gainsaying.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nPress me not, beseech you, so.\\nThere is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,\\nSo soon as yours could win me: so it should now,\\nWere there necessity in your request, although\\n'Twere needful I denied it.

When at Bohemia\\nYou take my lord, I'll give him my commission\\nTo let him there a month behind the gest\\nPrefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,\\nI love thee not a jar o' the clock behind\\nWhat lady-she her lord.

Verily,\\nYou shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's\\nAs potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?\\nForce me to keep you as a prisoner,\\nNot like a guest; so you shall pay your fees\\nWhen you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?\\nMy prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'\\nOne of them you shall be.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nYour guest, then, madam:\\nTo be your prisoner should import offending;\\nWhich is for me less easy to commit\\nThan you to punish.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNot your gaoler, then,\\nBut your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you\\nOf my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:\\nYou were pretty lordings then?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWe were, fair queen,\\nTwo lads that thought there was no more behind\\nBut such a day to-morrow as to-day,\\nAnd to be boy eternal.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWas not my lord\\nThe verier wag o' the two?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWe were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,\\nAnd bleat the one at the other: what we changed\\nWas innocence for innocence; we knew not\\nThe doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd\\nThat any did. Had we pursued that life,\\nAnd our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd\\nWith stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven\\nBoldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd\\nHereditary ours.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nBy this we gather\\nYou have tripp'd since.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO my most sacred lady!\\nTemptations have since then been born to's; for\\nIn those unfledged days was my wife a girl;\\nYour precious self had then not cross'd the eyes\\nOf my young play-fellow.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nGrace to boot!\\nOf this make no conclusion, lest you say\\nYour queen and I are devils: yet go on;\\nThe offences we have made you do we'll answer,\\nIf you first sinn'd with us and that with us\\nYou did continue fault and that you slipp'd not\\nWith any but with us.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIs he won yet?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nHe'll stay my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAt my request he would not.\\nHermione, my dearest, thou never spokest\\nTo better purpose.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNever?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNever, but once.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat! have I twice said well? when was't before?\\nI prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's\\nAs fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless\\nSlaughters a thousand waiting upon that.\\nOur praises are our wages: you may ride's\\nWith one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere\\nWith spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:\\nMy last good deed was to entreat his stay:\\nWhat was my first? it has an elder sister,\\nOr I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!\\nBut once before I spoke to the purpose: when?\\nNay, let me have't; I long.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, that was when\\nThree crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,\\nEre I could make thee open thy white hand\\nAnd clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter\\n'I am yours for ever.'\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\n'Tis grace indeed.\\nWhy, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:\\nThe one for ever earn'd a royal husband;\\nThe other for some while a friend.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nAy, my good lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI' fecks!\\nWhy, that's my bawcock. What, hast\\nsmutch'd thy nose?\\nThey say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,\\nWe must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:\\nAnd yet the steer, the heifer and the calf\\nAre all call'd neat.--Still virginalling\\nUpon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!\\nArt thou my calf?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nYes, if you will, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,\\nTo be full like me: yet they say we are\\nAlmost as like as eggs; women say so,\\nThat will say anything but were they false\\nAs o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false\\nAs dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes\\nNo bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true\\nTo say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,\\nLook on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!\\nMost dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--\\nAffection! thy intention stabs the centre:\\nThou dost make possible things not so held,\\nCommunicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--\\nWith what's unreal thou coactive art,\\nAnd fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent\\nThou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,\\nAnd that beyond commission, and I find it,\\nAnd that to the infection of my brains\\nAnd hardening of my brows.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat means Sicilia?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nHe something seems unsettled.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow, my lord!\\nWhat cheer? how is't with you, best brother?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nYou look as if you held a brow of much distraction\\nAre you moved, my lord?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo, in good earnest.\\nHow sometimes nature will betray its folly,\\nIts tenderness, and make itself a pastime\\nTo harder bosoms! Looking on the lines\\nOf my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil\\nTwenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,\\nIn my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,\\nLest it should bite its master, and so prove,\\nAs ornaments oft do, too dangerous:\\nHow like, methought, I then was to this kernel,\\nThis squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,\\nWill you take eggs for money?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNo, my lord, I'll fight.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,\\nAre you so fond of your young prince as we\\nDo seem to be of ours?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nIf at home, sir,\\nHe's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,\\nNow my sworn friend and then mine enemy,\\nMy parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:\\nHe makes a July's day short as December,\\nAnd with his varying childness cures in me\\nThoughts that would thick my blood.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSo stands this squire\\nOfficed with me: we two will walk, my lord,\\nAnd leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,\\nHow thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;\\nLet what is dear in Sicily be cheap:\\nNext to thyself and my young rover, he's\\nApparent to my heart.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nIf you would seek us,\\nWe are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,\\nBe you beneath the sky.\\nI am angling now,\\nThough you perceive me not how I give line.\\nGo to, go to!\\nHow she holds up the neb, the bill to him!\\nAnd arms her with the boldness of a wife\\nTo her allowing husband!\\nGone already!\\nInch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and\\nears a fork'd one!\\nGo, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I\\nPlay too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue\\nWill hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour\\nWill be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.\\nThere have been,\\nOr I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;\\nAnd many a man there is, even at this present,\\nNow while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,\\nThat little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence\\nAnd his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by\\nSir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't\\nWhiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,\\nAs mine, against their will. Should all despair\\nThat have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind\\nWould hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;\\nIt is a bawdy planet, that will strike\\nWhere 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,\\nFrom east, west, north and south: be it concluded,\\nNo barricado for a belly; know't;\\nIt will let in and out the enemy\\nWith bag and baggage: many thousand on's\\nHave the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nI am like you, they say.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nAy, my good lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.\\nCamillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nYou had much ado to make his anchor hold:\\nWhen you cast out, it still came home.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDidst note it?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe would not stay at your petitions: made\\nHis business more material.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nDidst perceive it?\\nThey're here with me already, whispering, rounding\\n'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,\\nWhen I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,\\nThat he did stay?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nAt the good queen's entreaty.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAt the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent\\nBut, so it is, it is not. Was this taken\\nBy any understanding pate but thine?\\nFor thy conceit is soaking, will draw in\\nMore than the common blocks: not noted, is't,\\nBut of the finer natures? by some severals\\nOf head-piece extraordinary? lower messes\\nPerchance are to this business purblind? say.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBusiness, my lord! I think most understand\\nBohemia stays here longer.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHa!\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nStays here longer.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nAy, but why?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nTo satisfy your highness and the entreaties\\nOf our most gracious mistress.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSatisfy!\\nThe entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!\\nLet that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,\\nWith all the nearest things to my heart, as well\\nMy chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou\\nHast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed\\nThy penitent reform'd: but we have been\\nDeceived in thy integrity, deceived\\nIn that which seems so.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBe it forbid, my lord!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,\\nIf thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,\\nWhich hoxes honesty behind, restraining\\nFrom course required; or else thou must be counted\\nA servant grafted in my serious trust\\nAnd therein negligent; or else a fool\\nThat seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,\\nAnd takest it all for jest.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy gracious lord,\\nI may be negligent, foolish and fearful;\\nIn every one of these no man is free,\\nBut that his negligence, his folly, fear,\\nAmong the infinite doings of the world,\\nSometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,\\nIf ever I were wilful-negligent,\\nIt was my folly; if industriously\\nI play'd the fool, it was my negligence,\\nNot weighing well the end; if ever fearful\\nTo do a thing, where I the issue doubted,\\nWhere of the execution did cry out\\nAgainst the non-performance, 'twas a fear\\nWhich oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,\\nAre such allow'd infirmities that honesty\\nIs never free of. But, beseech your grace,\\nBe plainer with me; let me know my trespass\\nBy its own visage: if I then deny it,\\n'Tis none of mine.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHa' not you seen, Camillo,--\\nBut that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass\\nIs thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--\\nFor to a vision so apparent rumour\\nCannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation\\nResides not in that man that does not think,--\\nMy wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,\\nOr else be impudently negative,\\nTo have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say\\nMy wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name\\nAs rank as any flax-wench that puts to\\nBefore her troth-plight: say't and justify't.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI would not be a stander-by to hear\\nMy sovereign mistress clouded so, without\\nMy present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,\\nYou never spoke what did become you less\\nThan this; which to reiterate were sin\\nAs deep as that, though true.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIs whispering nothing?\\nIs leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?\\nKissing with inside lip? stopping the career\\nOf laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible\\nOf breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?\\nSkulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?\\nHours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes\\nBlind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,\\nThat would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?\\nWhy, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;\\nThe covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;\\nMy wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,\\nIf this be nothing.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nGood my lord, be cured\\nOf this diseased opinion, and betimes;\\nFor 'tis most dangerous.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nSay it be, 'tis true.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNo, no, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIt is; you lie, you lie:\\nI say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,\\nPronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,\\nOr else a hovering temporizer, that\\nCanst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,\\nInclining to them both: were my wife's liver\\nInfected as her life, she would not live\\nThe running of one glass.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nWho does infect her?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, he that wears her like a medal, hanging\\nAbout his neck, Bohemia: who, if I\\nHad servants true about me, that bare eyes\\nTo see alike mine honour as their profits,\\nTheir own particular thrifts, they would do that\\nWhich should undo more doing: ay, and thou,\\nHis cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form\\nHave benched and reared to worship, who mayst see\\nPlainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,\\nHow I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,\\nTo give mine enemy a lasting wink;\\nWhich draught to me were cordial.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, my lord,\\nI could do this, and that with no rash potion,\\nBut with a lingering dram that should not work\\nMaliciously like poison: but I cannot\\nBelieve this crack to be in my dread mistress,\\nSo sovereignly being honourable.\\nI have loved thee,--\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMake that thy question, and go rot!\\nDost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,\\nTo appoint myself in this vexation, sully\\nThe purity and whiteness of my sheets,\\nWhich to preserve is sleep, which being spotted\\nIs goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,\\nGive scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,\\nWho I do think is mine and love as mine,\\nWithout ripe moving to't? Would I do this?\\nCould man so blench?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI must believe you, sir:\\nI do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;\\nProvided that, when he's removed, your highness\\nWill take again your queen as yours at first,\\nEven for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing\\nThe injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms\\nKnown and allied to yours.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou dost advise me\\nEven so as I mine own course have set down:\\nI'll give no blemish to her honour, none.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nMy lord,\\nGo then; and with a countenance as clear\\nAs friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia\\nAnd with your queen. I am his cupbearer:\\nIf from me he have wholesome beverage,\\nAccount me not your servant.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThis is all:\\nDo't and thou hast the one half of my heart;\\nDo't not, thou split'st thine own.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI'll do't, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nO miserable lady! But, for me,\\nWhat case stand I in? I must be the poisoner\\nOf good Polixenes; and my ground to do't\\nIs the obedience to a master, one\\nWho in rebellion with himself will have\\nAll that are his so too. To do this deed,\\nPromotion follows. If I could find example\\nOf thousands that had struck anointed kings\\nAnd flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since\\nNor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,\\nLet villany itself forswear't. I must\\nForsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain\\nTo me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!\\nHere comes Bohemia.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is strange: methinks\\nMy favour here begins to warp. Not speak?\\nGood day, Camillo.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHail, most royal sir!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat is the news i' the court?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nNone rare, my lord.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThe king hath on him such a countenance\\nAs he had lost some province and a region\\nLoved as he loves himself: even now I met him\\nWith customary compliment; when he,\\nWafting his eyes to the contrary and falling\\nA lip of much contempt, speeds from me and\\nSo leaves me to consider what is breeding\\nThat changeth thus his manners.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI dare not know, my lord.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?\\nBe intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;\\nFor, to yourself, what you do know, you must.\\nAnd cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,\\nYour changed complexions are to me a mirror\\nWhich shows me mine changed too; for I must be\\nA party in this alteration, finding\\nMyself thus alter'd with 't.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThere is a sickness\\nWhich puts some of us in distemper, but\\nI cannot name the disease; and it is caught\\nOf you that yet are well.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow! caught of me!\\nMake me not sighted like the basilisk:\\nI have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better\\nBy my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--\\nAs you are certainly a gentleman, thereto\\nClerk-like experienced, which no less adorns\\nOur gentry than our parents' noble names,\\nIn whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,\\nIf you know aught which does behove my knowledge\\nThereof to be inform'd, imprison't not\\nIn ignorant concealment.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI may not answer.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nA sickness caught of me, and yet I well!\\nI must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,\\nI conjure thee, by all the parts of man\\nWhich honour does acknowledge, whereof the least\\nIs not this suit of mine, that thou declare\\nWhat incidency thou dost guess of harm\\nIs creeping toward me; how far off, how near;\\nWhich way to be prevented, if to be;\\nIf not, how best to bear it.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, I will tell you;\\nSince I am charged in honour and by him\\nThat I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,\\nWhich must be even as swiftly follow'd as\\nI mean to utter it, or both yourself and me\\nCry lost, and so good night!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nOn, good Camillo.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI am appointed him to murder you.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nBy whom, Camillo?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nBy the king.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nFor what?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,\\nAs he had seen't or been an instrument\\nTo vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen\\nForbiddenly.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO, then my best blood turn\\nTo an infected jelly and my name\\nBe yoked with his that did betray the Best!\\nTurn then my freshest reputation to\\nA savour that may strike the dullest nostril\\nWhere I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,\\nNay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection\\nThat e'er was heard or read!\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSwear his thought over\\nBy each particular star in heaven and\\nBy all their influences, you may as well\\nForbid the sea for to obey the moon\\nAs or by oath remove or counsel shake\\nThe fabric of his folly, whose foundation\\nIs piled upon his faith and will continue\\nThe standing of his body.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nHow should this grow?\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to\\nAvoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.\\nIf therefore you dare trust my honesty,\\nThat lies enclosed in this trunk which you\\nShall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!\\nYour followers I will whisper to the business,\\nAnd will by twos and threes at several posterns\\nClear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put\\nMy fortunes to your service, which are here\\nBy this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;\\nFor, by the honour of my parents, I\\nHave utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,\\nI dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer\\nThan one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon\\nHis execution sworn.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI do believe thee:\\nI saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:\\nBe pilot to me and thy places shall\\nStill neighbour mine. My ships are ready and\\nMy people did expect my hence departure\\nTwo days ago. This jealousy\\nIs for a precious creature: as she's rare,\\nMust it be great, and as his person's mighty,\\nMust it be violent, and as he does conceive\\nHe is dishonour'd by a man which ever\\nProfess'd to him, why, his revenges must\\nIn that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:\\nGood expedition be my friend, and comfort\\nThe gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing\\nOf his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;\\nI will respect thee as a father if\\nThou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nIt is in mine authority to command\\nThe keys of all the posterns: please your highness\\nTo take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nTake the boy to you: he so troubles me,\\n'Tis past enduring.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nCome, my gracious lord,\\nShall I be your playfellow?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNo, I'll none of you.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nWhy, my sweet lord?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nYou'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if\\nI were a baby still. I love you better.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nAnd why so, my lord?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNot for because\\nYour brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,\\nBecome some women best, so that there be not\\nToo much hair there, but in a semicircle\\nOr a half-moon made with a pen.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nWho taught you this?\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nI learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now\\nWhat colour are your eyebrows?\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nBlue, my lord.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nNay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose\\nThat has been blue, but not her eyebrows.\\n\\nFirst Lady:\\nHark ye;\\nThe queen your mother rounds apace: we shall\\nPresent our services to a fine new prince\\nOne of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,\\nIf we would have you.\\n\\nSecond Lady:\\nShe is spread of late\\nInto a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now\\nI am for you again: pray you, sit by us,\\nAnd tell 's a tale.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nMerry or sad shall't be?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nAs merry as you will.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nA sad tale's best for winter: I have one\\nOf sprites and goblins.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nLet's have that, good sir.\\nCome on, sit down: come on, and do your best\\nTo fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nThere was a man--\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNay, come, sit down; then on.\\n\\nMAMILLIUS:\\nDwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;\\nYond crickets shall not hear it.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nCome on, then,\\nAnd give't me in mine ear.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWas he met there? his train? Camillo with him?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBehind the tuft of pines I met them; never\\nSaw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them\\nEven to their ships.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow blest am I\\nIn my just censure, in my true opinion!\\nAlack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed\\nIn being so blest! There may be in the cup\\nA spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,\\nAnd yet partake no venom, for his knowledge\\nIs not infected: but if one present\\nThe abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known\\nHow he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,\\nWith violent hefts. I have drunk,\\nand seen the spider.\\nCamillo was his help in this, his pander:\\nThere is a plot against my life, my crown;\\nAll's true that is mistrusted: that false villain\\nWhom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:\\nHe has discover'd my design, and I\\nRemain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick\\nFor them to play at will. How came the posterns\\nSo easily open?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBy his great authority;\\nWhich often hath no less prevail'd than so\\nOn your command.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI know't too well.\\nGive me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:\\nThough he does bear some signs of me, yet you\\nHave too much blood in him.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWhat is this? sport?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nBear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;\\nAway with him! and let her sport herself\\nWith that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes\\nHas made thee swell thus.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nBut I'ld say he had not,\\nAnd I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,\\nHowe'er you lean to the nayward.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou, my lords,\\nLook on her, mark her well; be but about\\nTo say 'she is a goodly lady,' and\\nThe justice of your bearts will thereto add\\n'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'\\nPraise her but for this her without-door form,\\nWhich on my faith deserves high speech, and straight\\nThe shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands\\nThat calumny doth use--O, I am out--\\nThat mercy does, for calumny will sear\\nVirtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,\\nWhen you have said 'she's goodly,' come between\\nEre you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,\\nFrom him that has most cause to grieve it should be,\\nShe's an adulteress.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nShould a villain say so,\\nThe most replenish'd villain in the world,\\nHe were as much more villain: you, my lord,\\nDo but mistake.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou have mistook, my lady,\\nPolixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!\\nWhich I'll not call a creature of thy place,\\nLest barbarism, making me the precedent,\\nShould a like language use to all degrees\\nAnd mannerly distinguishment leave out\\nBetwixt the prince and beggar: I have said\\nShe's an adulteress; I have said with whom:\\nMore, she's a traitor and Camillo is\\nA federary with her, and one that knows\\nWhat she should shame to know herself\\nBut with her most vile principal, that she's\\nA bed-swerver, even as bad as those\\nThat vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy\\nTo this their late escape.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nNo, by my life.\\nPrivy to none of this. How will this grieve you,\\nWhen you shall come to clearer knowledge, that\\nYou thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,\\nYou scarce can right me throughly then to say\\nYou did mistake.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo; if I mistake\\nIn those foundations which I build upon,\\nThe centre is not big enough to bear\\nA school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!\\nHe who shall speak for her is afar off guilty\\nBut that he speaks.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThere's some ill planet reigns:\\nI must be patient till the heavens look\\nWith an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,\\nI am not prone to weeping, as our sex\\nCommonly are; the want of which vain dew\\nPerchance shall dry your pities: but I have\\nThat honourable grief lodged here which burns\\nWorse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,\\nWith thoughts so qualified as your charities\\nShall best instruct you, measure me; and so\\nThe king's will be perform'd!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nShall I be heard?\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nWho is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,\\nMy women may be with me; for you see\\nMy plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;\\nThere is no cause: when you shall know your mistress\\nHas deserved prison, then abound in tears\\nAs I come out: this action I now go on\\nIs for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:\\nI never wish'd to see you sorry; now\\nI trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo, do our bidding; hence!\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBeseech your highness, call the queen again.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nBe certain what you do, sir, lest your justice\\nProve violence; in the which three great ones suffer,\\nYourself, your queen, your son.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nFor her, my lord,\\nI dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,\\nPlease you to accept it, that the queen is spotless\\nI' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,\\nIn this which you accuse her.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIf it prove\\nShe's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where\\nI lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;\\nThan when I feel and see her no farther trust her;\\nFor every inch of woman in the world,\\nAy, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHold your peaces.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nGood my lord,--\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIt is for you we speak, not for ourselves:\\nYou are abused and by some putter-on\\nThat will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,\\nI would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,\\nI have three daughters; the eldest is eleven\\nThe second and the third, nine, and some five;\\nIf this prove true, they'll pay for't:\\nby mine honour,\\nI'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,\\nTo bring false generations: they are co-heirs;\\nAnd I had rather glib myself than they\\nShould not produce fair issue.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nCease; no more.\\nYou smell this business with a sense as cold\\nAs is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't\\nAs you feel doing thus; and see withal\\nThe instruments that feel.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nIf it be so,\\nWe need no grave to bury honesty:\\nThere's not a grain of it the face to sweeten\\nOf the whole dungy earth.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat! lack I credit?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nI had rather you did lack than I, my lord,\\nUpon this ground; and more it would content me\\nTo have her honour true than your suspicion,\\nBe blamed for't how you might.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhy, what need we\\nCommune with you of this, but rather follow\\nOur forceful instigation? Our prerogative\\nCalls not your counsels, but our natural goodness\\nImparts this; which if you, or stupefied\\nOr seeming so in skill, cannot or will not\\nRelish a truth like us, inform yourselves\\nWe need no more of your advice: the matter,\\nThe loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all\\nProperly ours.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nAnd I wish, my liege,\\nYou had only in your silent judgment tried it,\\nWithout more overture.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow could that be?\\nEither thou art most ignorant by age,\\nOr thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,\\nAdded to their familiarity,\\nWhich was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,\\nThat lack'd sight only, nought for approbation\\nBut only seeing, all other circumstances\\nMade up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:\\nYet, for a greater confirmation,\\nFor in an act of this importance 'twere\\nMost piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post\\nTo sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,\\nCleomenes and Dion, whom you know\\nOf stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle\\nThey will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,\\nShall stop or spur me. Have I done well?\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nWell done, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThough I am satisfied and need no more\\nThan what I know, yet shall the oracle\\nGive rest to the minds of others, such as he\\nWhose ignorant credulity will not\\nCome up to the truth. So have we thought it good\\nFrom our free person she should be confined,\\nLest that the treachery of the two fled hence\\nBe left her to perform. Come, follow us;\\nWe are to speak in public; for this business\\nWill raise us all.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThe keeper of the prison, call to him;\\nlet him have knowledge who I am.\\nGood lady,\\nNo court in Europe is too good for thee;\\nWhat dost thou then in prison?\\nNow, good sir,\\nYou know me, do you not?\\n\\nGaoler:\\nFor a worthy lady\\nAnd one whom much I honour.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nPray you then,\\nConduct me to the queen.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nI may not, madam:\\nTo the contrary I have express commandment.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nHere's ado,\\nTo lock up honesty and honour from\\nThe access of gentle visitors!\\nIs't lawful, pray you,\\nTo see her women? any of them? Emilia?\\n\\nGaoler:\\nSo please you, madam,\\nTo put apart these your attendants, I\\nShall bring Emilia forth.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI pray now, call her.\\nWithdraw yourselves.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nAnd, madam,\\nI must be present at your conference.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWell, be't so, prithee.\\nHere's such ado to make no stain a stain\\nAs passes colouring.\\nDear gentlewoman,\\nHow fares our gracious lady?\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nAs well as one so great and so forlorn\\nMay hold together: on her frights and griefs,\\nWhich never tender lady hath born greater,\\nShe is something before her time deliver'd.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nA boy?\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nA daughter, and a goodly babe,\\nLusty and like to live: the queen receives\\nMuch comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,\\nI am innocent as you.'\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI dare be sworn\\nThese dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,\\nbeshrew them!\\nHe must be told on't, and he shall: the office\\nBecomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:\\nIf I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister\\nAnd never to my red-look'd anger be\\nThe trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,\\nCommend my best obedience to the queen:\\nIf she dares trust me with her little babe,\\nI'll show't the king and undertake to be\\nHer advocate to the loud'st. We do not know\\nHow he may soften at the sight o' the child:\\nThe silence often of pure innocence\\nPersuades when speaking fails.\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nMost worthy madam,\\nYour honour and your goodness is so evident\\nThat your free undertaking cannot miss\\nA thriving issue: there is no lady living\\nSo meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship\\nTo visit the next room, I'll presently\\nAcquaint the queen of your most noble offer;\\nWho but to-day hammer'd of this design,\\nBut durst not tempt a minister of honour,\\nLest she should be denied.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nTell her, Emilia.\\nI'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't\\nAs boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted\\nI shall do good.\\n\\nEMILIA:\\nNow be you blest for it!\\nI'll to the queen: please you,\\ncome something nearer.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nMadam, if't please the queen to send the babe,\\nI know not what I shall incur to pass it,\\nHaving no warrant.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nYou need not fear it, sir:\\nThis child was prisoner to the womb and is\\nBy law and process of great nature thence\\nFreed and enfranchised, not a party to\\nThe anger of the king nor guilty of,\\nIf any be, the trespass of the queen.\\n\\nGaoler:\\nI do believe it.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nDo not you fear: upon mine honour,\\nI will stand betwixt you and danger.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness\\nTo bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If\\nThe cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,\\nShe the adulteress; for the harlot king\\nIs quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank\\nAnd level of my brain, plot-proof; but she\\nI can hook to me: say that she were gone,\\nGiven to the fire, a moiety of my rest\\nMight come to me again. Who's there?\\n\\nFirst Servant:\\nMy lord?\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow does the boy?\\n\\nFirst Servant:\\nHe took good rest to-night;\\n'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTo see his nobleness!\\nConceiving the dishonour of his mother,\\nHe straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,\\nFasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,\\nThrew off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,\\nAnd downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,\\nSee how he fares.\\nFie, fie! no thought of him:\\nThe thought of my revenges that way\\nRecoil upon me: in himself too mighty,\\nAnd in his parties, his alliance; let him be\\nUntil a time may serve: for present vengeance,\\nTake it on her. Camillo and Polixenes\\nLaugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:\\nThey should not laugh if I could reach them, nor\\nShall she within my power.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nYou must not enter.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:\\nFear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,\\nThan the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,\\nMore free than he is jealous.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nThat's enough.\\n\\nSecond Servant:\\nMadam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded\\nNone should come at him.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNot so hot, good sir:\\nI come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,\\nThat creep like shadows by him and do sigh\\nAt each his needless heavings, such as you\\nNourish the cause of his awaking: I\\nDo come with words as medicinal as true,\\nHonest as either, to purge him of that humour\\nThat presses him from sleep.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat noise there, ho?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNo noise, my lord; but needful conference\\nAbout some gossips for your highness.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow!\\nAway with that audacious lady! Antigonus,\\nI charged thee that she should not come about me:\\nI knew she would.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI told her so, my lord,\\nOn your displeasure's peril and on mine,\\nShe should not visit you.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat, canst not rule her?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nFrom all dishonesty he can: in this,\\nUnless he take the course that you have done,\\nCommit me for committing honour, trust it,\\nHe shall not rule me.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nLa you now, you hear:\\nWhen she will take the rein I let her run;\\nBut she'll not stumble.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nGood my liege, I come;\\nAnd, I beseech you, hear me, who profess\\nMyself your loyal servant, your physician,\\nYour most obedient counsellor, yet that dare\\nLess appear so in comforting your evils,\\nThan such as most seem yours: I say, I come\\nFrom your good queen.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGood queen!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nGood queen, my lord,\\nGood queen; I say good queen;\\nAnd would by combat make her good, so were I\\nA man, the worst about you.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nForce her hence.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nLet him that makes but trifles of his eyes\\nFirst hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;\\nBut first I'll do my errand. The good queen,\\nFor she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;\\nHere 'tis; commends it to your blessing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOut!\\nA mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:\\nA most intelligencing bawd!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNot so:\\nI am as ignorant in that as you\\nIn so entitling me, and no less honest\\nThan you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,\\nAs this world goes, to pass for honest.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTraitors!\\nWill you not push her out? Give her the bastard.\\nThou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted\\nBy thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;\\nTake't up, I say; give't to thy crone.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nFor ever\\nUnvenerable be thy hands, if thou\\nTakest up the princess by that forced baseness\\nWhich he has put upon't!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHe dreads his wife.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nSo I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt\\nYou'ld call your children yours.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA nest of traitors!\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI am none, by this good light.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nNor I, nor any\\nBut one that's here, and that's himself, for he\\nThe sacred honour of himself, his queen's,\\nHis hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,\\nWhose sting is sharper than the sword's;\\nand will not--\\nFor, as the case now stands, it is a curse\\nHe cannot be compell'd to't--once remove\\nThe root of his opinion, which is rotten\\nAs ever oak or stone was sound.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA callat\\nOf boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband\\nAnd now baits me! This brat is none of mine;\\nIt is the issue of Polixenes:\\nHence with it, and together with the dam\\nCommit them to the fire!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nIt is yours;\\nAnd, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,\\nSo like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,\\nAlthough the print be little, the whole matter\\nAnd copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,\\nThe trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,\\nThe pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,\\nHis smiles,\\nThe very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:\\nAnd thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it\\nSo like to him that got it, if thou hast\\nThe ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours\\nNo yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,\\nHer children not her husband's!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nA gross hag\\nAnd, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,\\nThat wilt not stay her tongue.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nHang all the husbands\\nThat cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself\\nHardly one subject.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOnce more, take her hence.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nA most unworthy and unnatural lord\\nCan do no more.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI'll ha' thee burnt.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI care not:\\nIt is an heretic that makes the fire,\\nNot she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;\\nBut this most cruel usage of your queen,\\nNot able to produce more accusation\\nThan your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours\\nOf tyranny and will ignoble make you,\\nYea, scandalous to the world.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nOn your allegiance,\\nOut of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,\\nWhere were her life? she durst not call me so,\\nIf she did know me one. Away with her!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.\\nLook to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:\\nJove send her\\nA better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?\\nYou, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,\\nWill never do him good, not one of you.\\nSo, so: farewell; we are gone.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.\\nMy child? away with't! Even thou, that hast\\nA heart so tender o'er it, take it hence\\nAnd see it instantly consumed with fire;\\nEven thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:\\nWithin this hour bring me word 'tis done,\\nAnd by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,\\nWith what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse\\nAnd wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;\\nThe bastard brains with these my proper hands\\nShall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;\\nFor thou set'st on thy wife.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI did not, sir:\\nThese lords, my noble fellows, if they please,\\nCan clear me in't.\\n\\nLords:\\nWe can: my royal liege,\\nHe is not guilty of her coming hither.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou're liars all.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nBeseech your highness, give us better credit:\\nWe have always truly served you, and beseech you\\nSo to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,\\nAs recompense of our dear services\\nPast and to come, that you do change this purpose,\\nWhich being so horrible, so bloody, must\\nLead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI am a feather for each wind that blows:\\nShall I live on to see this bastard kneel\\nAnd call me father? better burn it now\\nThan curse it then. But be it; let it live.\\nIt shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;\\nYou that have been so tenderly officious\\nWith Lady Margery, your midwife there,\\nTo save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,\\nSo sure as this beard's grey,\\n--what will you adventure\\nTo save this brat's life?\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nAny thing, my lord,\\nThat my ability may undergo\\nAnd nobleness impose: at least thus much:\\nI'll pawn the little blood which I have left\\nTo save the innocent: any thing possible.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nIt shall be possible. Swear by this sword\\nThou wilt perform my bidding.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI will, my lord.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nMark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail\\nOf any point in't shall not only be\\nDeath to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,\\nWhom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,\\nAs thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry\\nThis female bastard hence and that thou bear it\\nTo some remote and desert place quite out\\nOf our dominions, and that there thou leave it,\\nWithout more mercy, to its own protection\\nAnd favour of the climate. As by strange fortune\\nIt came to us, I do in justice charge thee,\\nOn thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,\\nThat thou commend it strangely to some place\\nWhere chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nI swear to do this, though a present death\\nHad been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:\\nSome powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens\\nTo be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say\\nCasting their savageness aside have done\\nLike offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous\\nIn more than this deed does require! And blessing\\nAgainst this cruelty fight on thy side,\\nPoor thing, condemn'd to loss!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nNo, I'll not rear\\nAnother's issue.\\n\\nServant:\\nPlease your highness, posts\\nFrom those you sent to the oracle are come\\nAn hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,\\nBeing well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,\\nHasting to the court.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nSo please you, sir, their speed\\nHath been beyond account.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTwenty-three days\\nThey have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells\\nThe great Apollo suddenly will have\\nThe truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;\\nSummon a session, that we may arraign\\nOur most disloyal lady, for, as she hath\\nBeen publicly accused, so shall she have\\nA just and open trial. While she lives\\nMy heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,\\nAnd think upon my bidding.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nThe climate's delicate, the air most sweet,\\nFertile the isle, the temple much surpassing\\nThe common praise it bears.\\n\\nDION:\\nI shall report,\\nFor most it caught me, the celestial habits,\\nMethinks I so should term them, and the reverence\\nOf the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!\\nHow ceremonious, solemn and unearthly\\nIt was i' the offering!\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nBut of all, the burst\\nAnd the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,\\nKin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.\\nThat I was nothing.\\n\\nDION:\\nIf the event o' the journey\\nProve as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--\\nAs it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,\\nThe time is worth the use on't.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nGreat Apollo\\nTurn all to the best! These proclamations,\\nSo forcing faults upon Hermione,\\nI little like.\\n\\nDION:\\nThe violent carriage of it\\nWill clear or end the business: when the oracle,\\nThus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,\\nShall the contents discover, something rare\\nEven then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!\\nAnd gracious be the issue!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThis sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,\\nEven pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried\\nThe daughter of a king, our wife, and one\\nOf us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd\\nOf being tyrannous, since we so openly\\nProceed in justice, which shall have due course,\\nEven to the guilt or the purgation.\\nProduce the prisoner.\\n\\nOfficer:\\nIt is his highness' pleasure that the queen\\nAppear in person here in court. Silence!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nRead the indictment.\\n\\nOfficer:\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSince what I am to say must be but that\\nWhich contradicts my accusation and\\nThe testimony on my part no other\\nBut what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me\\nTo say 'not guilty:' mine integrity\\nBeing counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,\\nBe so received. But thus: if powers divine\\nBehold our human actions, as they do,\\nI doubt not then but innocence shall make\\nFalse accusation blush and tyranny\\nTremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,\\nWho least will seem to do so, my past life\\nHath been as continent, as chaste, as true,\\nAs I am now unhappy; which is more\\nThan history can pattern, though devised\\nAnd play'd to take spectators. For behold me\\nA fellow of the royal bed, which owe\\nA moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,\\nThe mother to a hopeful prince, here standing\\nTo prate and talk for life and honour 'fore\\nWho please to come and hear. For life, I prize it\\nAs I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,\\n'Tis a derivative from me to mine,\\nAnd only that I stand for. I appeal\\nTo your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes\\nCame to your court, how I was in your grace,\\nHow merited to be so; since he came,\\nWith what encounter so uncurrent I\\nHave strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond\\nThe bound of honour, or in act or will\\nThat way inclining, harden'd be the hearts\\nOf all that hear me, and my near'st of kin\\nCry fie upon my grave!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nI ne'er heard yet\\nThat any of these bolder vices wanted\\nLess impudence to gainsay what they did\\nThan to perform it first.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThat's true enough;\\nThrough 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou will not own it.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nMore than mistress of\\nWhich comes to me in name of fault, I must not\\nAt all acknowledge. For Polixenes,\\nWith whom I am accused, I do confess\\nI loved him as in honour he required,\\nWith such a kind of love as might become\\nA lady like me, with a love even such,\\nSo and no other, as yourself commanded:\\nWhich not to have done I think had been in me\\nBoth disobedience and ingratitude\\nTo you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,\\nEven since it could speak, from an infant, freely\\nThat it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,\\nI know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd\\nFor me to try how: all I know of it\\nIs that Camillo was an honest man;\\nAnd why he left your court, the gods themselves,\\nWotting no more than I, are ignorant.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYou knew of his departure, as you know\\nWhat you have underta'en to do in's absence.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSir,\\nYou speak a language that I understand not:\\nMy life stands in the level of your dreams,\\nWhich I'll lay down.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nYour actions are my dreams;\\nYou had a bastard by Polixenes,\\nAnd I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--\\nThose of your fact are so--so past all truth:\\nWhich to deny concerns more than avails; for as\\nThy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,\\nNo father owning it,--which is, indeed,\\nMore criminal in thee than it,--so thou\\nShalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage\\nLook for no less than death.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nSir, spare your threats:\\nThe bug which you would fright me with I seek.\\nTo me can life be no commodity:\\nThe crown and comfort of my life, your favour,\\nI do give lost; for I do feel it gone,\\nBut know not how it went. My second joy\\nAnd first-fruits of my body, from his presence\\nI am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort\\nStarr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,\\nThe innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,\\nHaled out to murder: myself on every post\\nProclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred\\nThe child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs\\nTo women of all fashion; lastly, hurried\\nHere to this place, i' the open air, before\\nI have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,\\nTell me what blessings I have here alive,\\nThat I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.\\nBut yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,\\nI prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,\\nWhich I would free, if I shall be condemn'd\\nUpon surmises, all proofs sleeping else\\nBut what your jealousies awake, I tell you\\n'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,\\nI do refer me to the oracle:\\nApollo be my judge!\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nThis your request\\nIs altogether just: therefore bring forth,\\nAnd in Apollos name, his oracle.\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nThe Emperor of Russia was my father:\\nO that he were alive, and here beholding\\nHis daughter's trial! that he did but see\\nThe flatness of my misery, yet with eyes\\nOf pity, not revenge!\\n\\nOfficer:\\nYou here shall swear upon this sword of justice,\\nThat you, Cleomenes and Dion, have\\nBeen both at Delphos, and from thence have brought\\nThe seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd\\nOf great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,\\nYou have not dared to break the holy seal\\nNor read the secrets in't.\\n\\nCLEOMENES:\\nAll this we swear.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nBreak up the seals and read.\\n\\nOfficer:\\n\\nLords:\\nNow blessed be the great Apollo!\\n\\nHERMIONE:\\nPraised!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHast thou read truth?\\n\\nOfficer:\\nAy, my lord; even so\\nAs it is here set down.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThere is no truth at all i' the oracle:\\nThe sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.\\n\\nServant:\\nMy lord the king, the king!\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nWhat is the business?\\n\\nServant:\\nO sir, I shall be hated to report it!\\nThe prince your son, with mere conceit and fear\\nOf the queen's speed, is gone.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nHow! gone!\\n\\nServant:\\nIs dead.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nApollo's angry; and the heavens themselves\\nDo strike at my injustice.\\nHow now there!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nThis news is mortal to the queen: look down\\nAnd see what death is doing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nTake her hence:\\nHer heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:\\nI have too much believed mine own suspicion:\\nBeseech you, tenderly apply to her\\nSome remedies for life.\\nApollo, pardon\\nMy great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!\\nI'll reconcile me to Polixenes,\\nNew woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,\\nWhom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;\\nFor, being transported by my jealousies\\nTo bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose\\nCamillo for the minister to poison\\nMy friend Polixenes: which had been done,\\nBut that the good mind of Camillo tardied\\nMy swift command, though I with death and with\\nReward did threaten and encourage him,\\nNot doing 't and being done: he, most humane\\nAnd fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest\\nUnclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,\\nWhich you knew great, and to the hazard\\nOf all encertainties himself commended,\\nNo richer than his honour: how he glisters\\nThorough my rust! and how his pity\\nDoes my deeds make the blacker!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWoe the while!\\nO, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,\\nBreak too.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nWhat fit is this, good lady?\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nWhat studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?\\nWhat wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?\\nIn leads or oils? what old or newer torture\\nMust I receive, whose every word deserves\\nTo taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny\\nTogether working with thy jealousies,\\nFancies too weak for boys, too green and idle\\nFor girls of nine, O, think what they have done\\nAnd then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all\\nThy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.\\nThat thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;\\nThat did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant\\nAnd damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,\\nThou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,\\nTo have him kill a king: poor trespasses,\\nMore monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon\\nThe casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter\\nTo be or none or little; though a devil\\nWould have shed water out of fire ere done't:\\nNor is't directly laid to thee, the death\\nOf the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,\\nThoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart\\nThat could conceive a gross and foolish sire\\nBlemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,\\nLaid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,\\nWhen I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,\\nThe sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,\\nand vengeance for't\\nNot dropp'd down yet.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nThe higher powers forbid!\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath\\nPrevail not, go and see: if you can bring\\nTincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,\\nHeat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you\\nAs I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!\\nDo not repent these things, for they are heavier\\nThan all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee\\nTo nothing but despair. A thousand knees\\nTen thousand years together, naked, fasting,\\nUpon a barren mountain and still winter\\nIn storm perpetual, could not move the gods\\nTo look that way thou wert.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nGo on, go on\\nThou canst not speak too much; I have deserved\\nAll tongues to talk their bitterest.\\n\\nFirst Lord:\\nSay no more:\\nHowe'er the business goes, you have made fault\\nI' the boldness of your speech.\\n\\nPAULINA:\\nI am sorry for't:\\nAll faults I make, when I shall come to know them,\\nI do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much\\nThe rashness of a woman: he is touch'd\\nTo the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help\\nShould be past grief: do not receive affliction\\nAt my petition; I beseech you, rather\\nLet me be punish'd, that have minded you\\nOf what you should forget. Now, good my liege\\nSir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:\\nThe love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--\\nI'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;\\nI'll not remember you of my own lord,\\nWho is lost too: take your patience to you,\\nAnd I'll say nothing.\\n\\nLEONTES:\\nThou didst speak but well\\nWhen most the truth; which I receive much better\\nThan to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me\\nTo the dead bodies of my queen and son:\\nOne grave shall be for both: upon them shall\\nThe causes of their death appear, unto\\nOur shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit\\nThe chapel where they lie, and tears shed there\\nShall be my recreation: so long as nature\\nWill bear up with this exercise, so long\\nI daily vow to use it. Come and lead me\\nUnto these sorrows.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nThou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon\\nThe deserts of Bohemia?\\n\\nMariner:\\nAy, my lord: and fear\\nWe have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly\\nAnd threaten present blusters. In my conscience,\\nThe heavens with that we have in hand are angry\\nAnd frown upon 's.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nTheir sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;\\nLook to thy bark: I'll not be long before\\nI call upon thee.\\n\\nMariner:\\nMake your best haste, and go not\\nToo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;\\nBesides, this place is famous for the creatures\\nOf prey that keep upon't.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nGo thou away:\\nI'll follow instantly.\\n\\nMariner:\\nI am glad at heart\\nTo be so rid o' the business.\\n\\nANTIGONUS:\\nCome, poor babe:\\nI have heard, but not believed,\\nthe spirits o' the dead\\nMay walk again: if such thing be, thy mother\\nAppear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream\\nSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,\\nSometimes her head on one side, some another;\\nI never saw a vessel of like sorrow,\\nSo fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,\\nLike very sanctity, she did approach\\nMy cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,\\nAnd gasping to begin some speech, her eyes\\nBecame two spouts: the fury spent, anon\\nDid this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,\\nSince fate, against thy better disposition,\\nHath made thy person for the thrower-out\\nOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,\\nPlaces remote enough are in Bohemia,\\nThere weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe\\nIs counted lost for ever, Perdita,\\nI prithee, call't. For this ungentle business\\nPut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see\\nThy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks\\nShe melted into air. Affrighted much,\\nI did in time collect myself and thought\\nThis was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:\\nYet for this once, yea, superstitiously,\\nI will be squared by this. I do believe\\nHermione hath suffer'd death, and that\\nApollo would, this being indeed the issue\\nOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,\\nEither for life or death, upon the earth\\nOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!\\nThere lie, and there thy character: there these;\\nWhich may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,\\nAnd still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,\\nThat for thy mother's fault art thus exposed\\nTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,\\nBut my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I\\nTo be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!\\nThe day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have\\nA lullaby too rough: I never saw\\nThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!\\nWell may I get aboard! This is the chase:\\nI am gone for ever.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nI would there were no age between sixteen and\\nthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the\\nrest; for there is nothing in the between but\\ngetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,\\nstealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but\\nthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty\\nhunt this weather? They have scared away two of my\\nbest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find\\nthan the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by\\nthe seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy\\nwill what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very\\npretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A\\npretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:\\nthough I am not bookish, yet I can read\\nwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been\\nsome stair-work, some trunk-work, some\\nbehind-door-work: they were warmer that got this\\nthan the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for\\npity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed\\nbut even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!\\n\\nClown:\\nHilloa, loa!\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWhat, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk\\non when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What\\nailest thou, man?\\n\\nClown:\\nI have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!\\nbut I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the\\nsky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust\\na bodkin's point.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWhy, boy, how is it?\\n\\nClown:\\nI would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,\\nhow it takes up the shore! but that's not the\\npoint. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!\\nsometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the\\nship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon\\nswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a\\ncork into a hogshead. And then for the\\nland-service, to see how the bear tore out his\\nshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said\\nhis name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an\\nend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned\\nit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the\\nsea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared\\nand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than\\nthe sea or weather.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nName of mercy, when was this, boy?\\n\\nClown:\\nNow, now: I have not winked since I saw these\\nsights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor\\nthe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it\\nnow.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nWould I had been by, to have helped the old man!\\n\\nClown:\\nI would you had been by the ship side, to have\\nhelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nHeavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,\\nboy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things\\ndying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for\\nthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's\\nchild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;\\nopen't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be\\nrich by the fairies. This is some changeling:\\nopen't. What's within, boy?\\n\\nClown:\\nYou're a made old man: if the sins of your youth\\nare forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThis is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up\\nwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.\\nWe are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires\\nnothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good\\nboy, the next way home.\\n\\nClown:\\nGo you the next way with your findings. I'll go see\\nif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much\\nhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when they\\nare hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury\\nit.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThat's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that\\nwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to the\\nsight of him.\\n\\nClown:\\nMarry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.\\n\\nShepherd:\\n'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.\\n\\nTime:\\nI, that please some, try all, both joy and terror\\nOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,\\nNow take upon me, in the name of Time,\\nTo use my wings. Impute it not a crime\\nTo me or my swift passage, that I slide\\nO'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried\\nOf that wide gap, since it is in my power\\nTo o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour\\nTo plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass\\nThe same I am, ere ancient'st order was\\nOr what is now received: I witness to\\nThe times that brought them in; so shall I do\\nTo the freshest things now reigning and make stale\\nThe glistering of this present, as my tale\\nNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,\\nI turn my glass and give my scene such growing\\nAs you had slept between: Leontes leaving,\\nThe effects of his fond jealousies so grieving\\nThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,\\nGentle spectators, that I now may be\\nIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,\\nI mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel\\nI now name to you; and with speed so pace\\nTo speak of Perdita, now grown in grace\\nEqual with wondering: what of her ensues\\nI list not prophecy; but let Time's news\\nBe known when 'tis brought forth.\\nA shepherd's daughter,\\nAnd what to her adheres, which follows after,\\nIs the argument of Time. Of this allow,\\nIf ever you have spent time worse ere now;\\nIf never, yet that Time himself doth say\\nHe wishes earnestly you never may.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:\\n'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to\\ngrant this.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nIt is fifteen years since I saw my country: though\\nI have for the most part been aired abroad, I\\ndesire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent\\nking, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling\\nsorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to\\nthink so, which is another spur to my departure.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nAs thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of\\nthy services by leaving me now: the need I have of\\nthee thine own goodness hath made; better not to\\nhave had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having\\nmade me businesses which none without thee can\\nsufficiently manage, must either stay to execute\\nthem thyself or take away with thee the very\\nservices thou hast done; which if I have not enough\\nconsidered, as too much I cannot, to be more\\nthankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit\\ntherein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal\\ncountry, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very\\nnaming punishes me with the remembrance of that\\npenitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,\\nmy brother; whose loss of his most precious queen\\nand children are even now to be afresh lamented.\\nSay to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my\\nson? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not\\nbeing gracious, than they are in losing them when\\nthey have approved their virtues.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nSir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What\\nhis happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I\\nhave missingly noted, he is of late much retired\\nfrom court and is less frequent to his princely\\nexercises than formerly he hath appeared.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nI have considered so much, Camillo, and with some\\ncare; so far that I have eyes under my service which\\nlook upon his removedness; from whom I have this\\nintelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a\\nmost homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from\\nvery nothing, and beyond the imagination of his\\nneighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a\\ndaughter of most rare note: the report of her is\\nextended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThat's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I\\nfear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou\\nshalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not\\nappearing what we are, have some question with the\\nshepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not\\nuneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.\\nPrithee, be my present partner in this business, and\\nlay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI willingly obey your command.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMy best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhen daffodils begin to peer,\\nWith heigh! the doxy over the dale,\\nWhy, then comes in the sweet o' the year;\\nFor the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.\\nThe white sheet bleaching on the hedge,\\nWith heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!\\nDoth set my pugging tooth on edge;\\nFor a quart of ale is a dish for a king.\\nThe lark, that tirra-lyra chants,\\nWith heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,\\nAre summer songs for me and my aunts,\\nWhile we lie tumbling in the hay.\\nI have served Prince Florizel and in my time\\nwore three-pile; but now I am out of service:\\nBut shall I go mourn for that, my dear?\\nThe pale moon shines by night:\\nAnd when I wander here and there,\\nI then do most go right.\\nIf tinkers may have leave to live,\\nAnd bear the sow-skin budget,\\nThen my account I well may, give,\\nAnd in the stocks avouch it.\\nMy traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to\\nlesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who\\nbeing, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise\\na snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and\\ndrab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is\\nthe silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful\\non the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to\\nme: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought\\nof it. A prize! a prize!\\n\\nClown:\\nLet me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod\\nyields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred\\nshorn. what comes the wool to?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nClown:\\nI cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am\\nI to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound\\nof sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will\\nthis sister of mine do with rice? But my father\\nhath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it\\non. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for\\nthe shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good\\nones; but they are most of them means and bases; but\\none puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to\\nhorn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden\\npies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;\\nnutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I\\nmay beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of\\nraisins o' the sun.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO that ever I was born!\\n\\nClown:\\nI' the name of me--\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and\\nthen, death, death!\\n\\nClown:\\nAlack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay\\non thee, rather than have these off.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more\\nthan the stripes I have received, which are mighty\\nones and millions.\\n\\nClown:\\nAlas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a\\ngreat matter.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel\\nta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon\\nme.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat, by a horseman, or a footman?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nA footman, sweet sir, a footman.\\n\\nClown:\\nIndeed, he should be a footman by the garments he\\nhas left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,\\nit hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,\\nI'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, good sir, tenderly, O!\\n\\nClown:\\nAlas, poor soul!\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nO, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my\\nshoulder-blade is out.\\n\\nClown:\\nHow now! canst stand?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\n\\nClown:\\nDost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNo, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have\\na kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,\\nunto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or\\nany thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;\\nthat kills my heart.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat manner of fellow was he that robbed you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nA fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with\\ntroll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the\\nprince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his\\nvirtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.\\n\\nClown:\\nHis vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped\\nout of the court: they cherish it to make it stay\\nthere; and yet it will no more but abide.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he\\nhath been since an ape-bearer; then a\\nprocess-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a\\nmotion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's\\nwife within a mile where my land and living lies;\\nand, having flown over many knavish professions, he\\nsettled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.\\n\\nClown:\\nOut upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts\\nwakes, fairs and bear-baitings.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVery true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that\\nput me into this apparel.\\n\\nClown:\\nNot a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had\\nbut looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am\\nfalse of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant\\nhim.\\n\\nClown:\\nHow do you now?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nSweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and\\nwalk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace\\nsoftly towards my kinsman's.\\n\\nClown:\\nShall I bring thee on the way?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNo, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.\\n\\nClown:\\nThen fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our\\nsheep-shearing.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nProsper you, sweet sir!\\nYour purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.\\nI'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I\\nmake not this cheat bring out another and the\\nshearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name\\nput in the book of virtue!\\nJog on, jog on, the foot-path way,\\nAnd merrily hent the stile-a:\\nA merry heart goes all the day,\\nYour sad tires in a mile-a.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nThese your unusual weeds to each part of you\\nDo give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora\\nPeering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing\\nIs as a meeting of the petty gods,\\nAnd you the queen on't.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSir, my gracious lord,\\nTo chide at your extremes it not becomes me:\\nO, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,\\nThe gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured\\nWith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,\\nMost goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts\\nIn every mess have folly and the feeders\\nDigest it with a custom, I should blush\\nTo see you so attired, sworn, I think,\\nTo show myself a glass.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI bless the time\\nWhen my good falcon made her flight across\\nThy father's ground.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nNow Jove afford you cause!\\nTo me the difference forges dread; your greatness\\nHath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble\\nTo think your father, by some accident,\\nShould pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!\\nHow would he look, to see his work so noble\\nVilely bound up? What would he say? Or how\\nShould I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold\\nThe sternness of his presence?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nApprehend\\nNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,\\nHumbling their deities to love, have taken\\nThe shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter\\nBecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune\\nA ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,\\nGolden Apollo, a poor humble swain,\\nAs I seem now. Their transformations\\nWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,\\nNor in a way so chaste, since my desires\\nRun not before mine honour, nor my lusts\\nBurn hotter than my faith.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO, but, sir,\\nYour resolution cannot hold, when 'tis\\nOpposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:\\nOne of these two must be necessities,\\nWhich then will speak, that you must\\nchange this purpose,\\nOr I my life.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nThou dearest Perdita,\\nWith these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not\\nThe mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,\\nOr not my father's. For I cannot be\\nMine own, nor any thing to any, if\\nI be not thine. To this I am most constant,\\nThough destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;\\nStrangle such thoughts as these with any thing\\nThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:\\nLift up your countenance, as it were the day\\nOf celebration of that nuptial which\\nWe two have sworn shall come.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO lady Fortune,\\nStand you auspicious!\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nSee, your guests approach:\\nAddress yourself to entertain them sprightly,\\nAnd let's be red with mirth.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nFie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon\\nThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,\\nBoth dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;\\nWould sing her song and dance her turn; now here,\\nAt upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;\\nOn his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire\\nWith labour and the thing she took to quench it,\\nShe would to each one sip. You are retired,\\nAs if you were a feasted one and not\\nThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid\\nThese unknown friends to's welcome; for it is\\nA way to make us better friends, more known.\\nCome, quench your blushes and present yourself\\nThat which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,\\nAnd bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,\\nAs your good flock shall prosper.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nShepherdess,\\nA fair one are you--well you fit our ages\\nWith flowers of winter.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSir, the year growing ancient,\\nNot yet on summer's death, nor on the birth\\nOf trembling winter, the fairest\\nflowers o' the season\\nAre our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,\\nWhich some call nature's bastards: of that kind\\nOur rustic garden's barren; and I care not\\nTo get slips of them.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWherefore, gentle maiden,\\nDo you neglect them?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nFor I have heard it said\\nThere is an art which in their piedness shares\\nWith great creating nature.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nSay there be;\\nYet nature is made better by no mean\\nBut nature makes that mean: so, over that art\\nWhich you say adds to nature, is an art\\nThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry\\nA gentler scion to the wildest stock,\\nAnd make conceive a bark of baser kind\\nBy bud of nobler race: this is an art\\nWhich does mend nature, change it rather, but\\nThe art itself is nature.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nSo it is.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThen make your garden rich in gillyvors,\\nAnd do not call them bastards.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI'll not put\\nThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;\\nNo more than were I painted I would wish\\nThis youth should say 'twere well and only therefore\\nDesire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;\\nHot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;\\nThe marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun\\nAnd with him rises weeping: these are flowers\\nOf middle summer, and I think they are given\\nTo men of middle age. You're very welcome.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nI should leave grazing, were I of your flock,\\nAnd only live by gazing.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nOut, alas!\\nYou'd be so lean, that blasts of January\\nWould blow you through and through.\\nNow, my fair'st friend,\\nI would I had some flowers o' the spring that might\\nBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,\\nThat wear upon your virgin branches yet\\nYour maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,\\nFor the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall\\nFrom Dis's waggon! daffodils,\\nThat come before the swallow dares, and take\\nThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,\\nBut sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes\\nOr Cytherea's breath; pale primroses\\nThat die unmarried, ere they can behold\\nBight Phoebus in his strength--a malady\\nMost incident to maids; bold oxlips and\\nThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,\\nThe flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,\\nTo make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,\\nTo strew him o'er and o'er!\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWhat, like a corse?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nNo, like a bank for love to lie and play on;\\nNot like a corse; or if, not to be buried,\\nBut quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:\\nMethinks I play as I have seen them do\\nIn Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine\\nDoes change my disposition.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nWhat you do\\nStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.\\nI'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,\\nI'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,\\nPray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,\\nTo sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you\\nA wave o' the sea, that you might ever do\\nNothing but that; move still, still so,\\nAnd own no other function: each your doing,\\nSo singular in each particular,\\nCrowns what you are doing in the present deed,\\nThat all your acts are queens.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nO Doricles,\\nYour praises are too large: but that your youth,\\nAnd the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,\\nDo plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,\\nWith wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,\\nYou woo'd me the false way.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI think you have\\nAs little skill to fear as I have purpose\\nTo put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:\\nYour hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,\\nThat never mean to part.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI'll swear for 'em.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is the prettiest low-born lass that ever\\nRan on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems\\nBut smacks of something greater than herself,\\nToo noble for this place.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nHe tells her something\\nThat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is\\nThe queen of curds and cream.\\n\\nClown:\\nCome on, strike up!\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nMopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,\\nTo mend her kissing with!\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nNow, in good time!\\n\\nClown:\\nNot a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.\\nCome, strike up!\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nPray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this\\nWhich dances with your daughter?\\n\\nShepherd:\\nThey call him Doricles; and boasts himself\\nTo have a worthy feeding: but I have it\\nUpon his own report and I believe it;\\nHe looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:\\nI think so too; for never gazed the moon\\nUpon the water as he'll stand and read\\nAs 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.\\nI think there is not half a kiss to choose\\nWho loves another best.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nShe dances featly.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nSo she does any thing; though I report it,\\nThat should be silent: if young Doricles\\nDo light upon her, she shall bring him that\\nWhich he not dreams of.\\n\\nServant:\\nO master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the\\ndoor, you would never dance again after a tabour and\\npipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings\\nseveral tunes faster than you'll tell money; he\\nutters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's\\nears grew to his tunes.\\n\\nClown:\\nHe could never come better; he shall come in. I\\nlove a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful\\nmatter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing\\nindeed and sung lamentably.\\n\\nServant:\\nHe hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no\\nmilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he\\nhas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without\\nbawdry, which is strange; with such delicate\\nburthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump\\nher;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,\\nas it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into\\nthe matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me\\nno harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with\\n'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nThis is a brave fellow.\\n\\nClown:\\nBelieve me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited\\nfellow. Has he any unbraided wares?\\n\\nServant:\\nHe hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;\\npoints more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can\\nlearnedly handle, though they come to him by the\\ngross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he\\nsings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you\\nwould think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants\\nto the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.\\n\\nClown:\\nPrithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nForewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.\\n\\nClown:\\nYou have of these pedlars, that have more in them\\nthan you'ld think, sister.\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nAy, good brother, or go about to think.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nLawn as white as driven snow;\\nCyprus black as e'er was crow;\\nGloves as sweet as damask roses;\\nMasks for faces and for noses;\\nBugle bracelet, necklace amber,\\nPerfume for a lady's chamber;\\nGolden quoifs and stomachers,\\nFor my lads to give their dears:\\nPins and poking-sticks of steel,\\nWhat maids lack from head to heel:\\nCome buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;\\nBuy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.\\n\\nClown:\\nIf I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take\\nno money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it\\nwill also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nI was promised them against the feast; but they come\\nnot too late now.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nHe hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nHe hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has\\npaid you more, which will shame you to give him again.\\n\\nClown:\\nIs there no manners left among maids? will they\\nwear their plackets where they should bear their\\nfaces? Is there not milking-time, when you are\\ngoing to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these\\nsecrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all\\nour guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour\\nyour tongues, and not a word more.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nI have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace\\nand a pair of sweet gloves.\\n\\nClown:\\nHave I not told thee how I was cozened by the way\\nand lost all my money?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAnd indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;\\ntherefore it behoves men to be wary.\\n\\nClown:\\nFear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.\\n\\nClown:\\nWhat hast here? ballads?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nPray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'\\nlife, for then we are sure they are true.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's\\nwife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a\\nburthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and\\ntoads carbonadoed.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nIs it true, think you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nVery true, and but a month old.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nBless me from marrying a usurer!\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress\\nTale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were\\npresent. Why should I carry lies abroad?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nPray you now, buy it.\\n\\nClown:\\nCome on, lay it by: and let's first see moe\\nballads; we'll buy the other things anon.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nHere's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon\\nthe coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,\\nforty thousand fathom above water, and sung this\\nballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was\\nthought she was a woman and was turned into a cold\\nfish for she would not exchange flesh with one that\\nloved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nIs it true too, think you?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nFive justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than\\nmy pack will hold.\\n\\nClown:\\nLay it by too: another.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nThis is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nLet's have some merry ones.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nWhy, this is a passing merry one and goes to\\nthe tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's\\nscarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in\\nrequest, I can tell you.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nWe can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou\\nshalt hear; 'tis in three parts.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWe had the tune on't a month ago.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nI can bear my part; you must know 'tis my\\noccupation; have at it with you.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nGet you hence, for I must go\\nWhere it fits not you to know.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhither?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nO, whither?\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhither?\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nIt becomes thy oath full well,\\nThou to me thy secrets tell.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nMe too, let me go thither.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nOr thou goest to the orange or mill.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nIf to either, thou dost ill.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNeither.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nWhat, neither?\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nNeither.\\n\\nDORCAS:\\nThou hast sworn my love to be.\\n\\nMOPSA:\\nThou hast sworn it more to me:\\nThen whither goest? say, whither?\\n\\nClown:\\nWe'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my\\nfather and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll\\nnot trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after\\nme. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's\\nhave the first choice. Follow me, girls.\\n\\nAUTOLYCUS:\\nAnd you shall pay well for 'em.\\nWill you buy any tape,\\nOr lace for your cape,\\nMy dainty duck, my dear-a?\\nAny silk, any thread,\\nAny toys for your head,\\nOf the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?\\nCome to the pedlar;\\nMoney's a medler.\\nThat doth utter all men's ware-a.\\n\\nServant:\\nMaster, there is three carters, three shepherds,\\nthree neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made\\nthemselves all men of hair, they call themselves\\nSaltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches\\nsay is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are\\nnot in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it\\nbe not too rough for some that know little but\\nbowling, it will please plentifully.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nAway! we'll none on 't: here has been too much\\nhomely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nYou weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see\\nthese four threes of herdsmen.\\n\\nServant:\\nOne three of them, by their own report, sir, hath\\ndanced before the king; and not the worst of the\\nthree but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nLeave your prating: since these good men are\\npleased, let them come in; but quickly now.\\n\\nServant:\\nWhy, they stay at door, sir.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nO, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.\\nIs it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.\\nHe's simple and tells much.\\nHow now, fair shepherd!\\nYour heart is full of something that does take\\nYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young\\nAnd handed love as you do, I was wont\\nTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd\\nThe pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it\\nTo her acceptance; you have let him go\\nAnd nothing marted with him. If your lass\\nInterpretation should abuse and call this\\nYour lack of love or bounty, you were straited\\nFor a reply, at least if you make a care\\nOf happy holding her.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nOld sir, I know\\nShe prizes not such trifles as these are:\\nThe gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd\\nUp in my heart; which I have given already,\\nBut not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life\\nBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,\\nHath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,\\nAs soft as dove's down and as white as it,\\nOr Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd\\nsnow that's bolted\\nBy the northern blasts twice o'er.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nWhat follows this?\\nHow prettily the young swain seems to wash\\nThe hand was fair before! I have put you out:\\nBut to your protestation; let me hear\\nWhat you profess.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nDo, and be witness to 't.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nAnd this my neighbour too?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nAnd he, and more\\nThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:\\nThat, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,\\nThereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth\\nThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge\\nMore than was ever man's, I would not prize them\\nWithout her love; for her employ them all;\\nCommend them and condemn them to her service\\nOr to their own perdition.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nFairly offer'd.\\n\\nCAMILLO:\\nThis shows a sound affection.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nBut, my daughter,\\nSay you the like to him?\\n\\nPERDITA:\\nI cannot speak\\nSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:\\nBy the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out\\nThe purity of his.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nTake hands, a bargain!\\nAnd, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:\\nI give my daughter to him, and will make\\nHer portion equal his.\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nO, that must be\\nI' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,\\nI shall have more than you can dream of yet;\\nEnough then for your wonder. But, come on,\\nContract us 'fore these witnesses.\\n\\nShepherd:\\nCome, your hand;\\nAnd, daughter, yours.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nSoft, swain, awhile, beseech you;\\nHave you a father?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nI have: but what of him?\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nKnows he of this?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nHe neither does nor shall.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nMethinks a father\\nIs at the nuptial of his son a guest\\nThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,\\nIs not your father grown incapable\\nOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupid\\nWith age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?\\nKnow man from man? dispute his own estate?\\nLies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing\\nBut what he did being childish?\\n\\nFLORIZEL:\\nNo, good sir;\\nHe has his health and ampler strength indeed\\nThan most have of his age.\\n\\nPOLIXENES:\\nBy my\""
